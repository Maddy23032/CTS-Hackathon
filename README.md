# Custom Web Vulnerability Scanner

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based, open-source command-line tool designed to automatically identify common web application vulnerabilities. Our primary goal is to empower developers and security professionals with a simple yet powerful scanner to strengthen application security and foster secure development practices early in the software development lifecycle.

The tool focuses on detecting vulnerabilities such as:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
